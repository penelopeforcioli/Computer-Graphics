# Computer Graphics Course Repository

This repository contains all the practical exercises, lab work, and two major projects developed during the Computer Graphics course. (https://synapses.polytechnique.fr/catalogue/2022-2023/ue/86/CSE306-computer-graphics?from=D12)

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into three main folders:

1. **Practical Exercises (TDs)**: This folder contains all the practical assignments and labs we completed during class. 
   
2. **Project 1: Ray Tracer**:
     - Diffuse and mirror surfaces.
     - Direct lighting and shadows for point light sources.
     - Indirect lighting (without Russian roulette).
     - Antialiasing for smoother rendering.
     - Ray-mesh intersection with Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) optimization.

4. **Project 2: 2D Fluid Solver**:
     - Create a Voronoï diagram using Voronoï Parallel Linear Enumeration.
     - Extend this to a Power diagram.
     - Optimize the weights of the Power diagram with LBFGS.
     - Implement de Gallouet-Mérigot's incompressible Euler scheme, incorporating fluid cell areas and spring forces.
